# Welcome to Screwdriver!

We've split up our documentation into three distinct sections depending on what you're looking for:

 - To learn more about Screwdriver in general, visit the [About](about/index.md) section.

- To find more information about managing your own Screwdriver cluster, visit the [Cluster Management](cluster-management/index.md) section.

- If you'd like to use Screwdriver to run a build, visit our [User Guide](user-guide/quickstart.md).

If you are new to Screwdriver, we suggest you start by reading through the [Domain model](about/appendix/domain.md) and [YAML configuration](user-guide/configuration/index.md) to get an idea of different concepts in Screwdriver and how they tie together.

To see some working examples, you can try out our [quickstart examples](user-guide/quickstart.md) with different languages to choose from.
